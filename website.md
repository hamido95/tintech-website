### Devops process
1. **Plan**

at the first step, we define the goals, requirements, and scope of a project, as well as creating a roadmap and timeline for its execution. 
1. **Code**

then, developers write and review code according to the project's requirements and best practices, ensuring that it is efficient, maintainable, and meets quality standards. 
1. **Build**

This process involves compiling the code into executable files or artifacts that can be deployed to various environments.
1. **Test**

Testing ensures that the software functions as intended by executing various test cases and scenarios to identify bugs or issues that need to be addressed before deployment.
1. **Deploy**

This process involves releasing the software to production or staging environments, ensuring that it is properly configured and ready for end-users.
1. **Operate**

Once deployed, this process focuses on managing and maintaining the software in production environments, including monitoring its performance, handling incidents or outages, and providing support to end-users.
1. **Monitor**

Monitoring involves continuously tracking the performance and health of the software in production environments through metrics, logs, alerts, and other monitoring tools.
1. **Improve**

The last process focuses on identifying areas for improvement in terms of performance, scalability, security, or user experience based on feedback from users or monitoring data. It includes implementing enhancements or optimizations to address these areas effectively.
